        <h2>üìú My Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Here lies my manifesto about how I should have become a Computer Science major my freshman year!
        </p>

        <p>
          Eat rocks!
        </p>

        <p>

        <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Projects</h2>

        <p>
          My first CompSci team project that I worked on was a Java based business inventory databased management
          system! It used MySQL to hold all the items within inventory for the business, as well as allowing
          modification to name, price, amount in stock, and complete removal as well as adding items to the database.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          I have learned a deep understanding of multiple programming languages...
          The majority of my understanding lies around the Java language and technologies that surround it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been attending the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay since 2019, where I hope to achieve my
          Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, with an emphasis on Software Engineering.

          machine. Through Print Pro, I have gained Forklift and Clamp Truck certifications, as well as experience in

          With the first half of that year spent working while attending UW - Green Bay. I then returned for summer of
          2022 as summer help.
