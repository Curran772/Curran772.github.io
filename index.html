        <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Projects</h2>

        <p>
          My first CompSci team project that I worked on was a Java based business inventory databased management
          system! It used MySQL to hold all the items within inventory for the business, as well as allowing
          modification to name, price, amount in stock, and complete removal as well as adding items to the database.
        </p>

        <p>
          My second project was similar to the first, however it emphasized more on the user experience this time
          around. It is a piece of software that would be used by a retail store and provides many of the expected
          functions that someone in retail would expect, such as, item manipulation (selling, changing inventory,
          modifying name, price quantity), sales price calculation, and much more.
        </p>

        <p>
          My most recent project includes this portfolio website! This was quite an undertaking, as I had to learn
          Javascript, as well as using some of the tools that surround that ecosystem. This project has been my only
          completely solo project thus far that is at this scope.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          I have learned a deep understanding of multiple programming languages...
          The majority of my understanding lies around the Java language and technologies that surround it.
          Recently, I have begun learning other languages such as C, C++, and Python.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been attending the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay since 2019, where I hope to achieve my
          Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, with an emphasis on Software Engineering. I currently plan on
          graduating in December 2023.

        <h2>üìÉ Work History</h2>

        <h3>ProAmpac</h3>
        <p>
          I worked at ProAmpac from August 2019 to January 2020. I worked as a Rewinder Assistant where I ensured the
          continued operation of an industrial paper rewinder. I learned multiple work skills here, including how
          to better operate as a team, effective communication skills, and proper time management skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Print Pro</h3>
        <p>
          I have worked the longest at Print Pro Inc. I was a Flexographic Print Press Assistant for the majority of
          my time at Print Pro. I have also worked as a Rewinder Operator for three months and would occasionally
          operate the Rewind machine in my periods of return afterwards. Through Print Pro, I have gained experience
          in material logistics and handling. I worked there originally from February 2nd, 2021 to August 31st, 2021.
          With the first half of that year spent working while attending UW - Green Bay. I then returned for summer of
          2022 as summer help, as well as over winter break of 2022 - 2023.
